# Changelog

All notable changes to **paper-wiki** are documented here. The format
is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The plugin protocol stays `@experimental` until v1.0; minor versions
before then may break it.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 6.1 — Vault layout cleanup

#### Changed (BREAKING)
- `ObsidianReporter` default `daily_subdir` changed from `"10_Daily"`
  to `"Daily"`. The numeric prefix was a Johnny.Decimal / PARA
  convention inherited from `evil-read-arxiv`; paper-wiki should not
  impose a personal-knowledge-management style on users who do not
  follow one. Defaults are now friendly; users who do use PARA can
  override `daily_subdir` per-recipe.
- Bundled recipes (`recipes/daily-arxiv.yaml`,
  `recipes/weekly-deep-dive.yaml`) updated to demonstrate the friendly
  defaults; an inline comment shows how Johnny.Decimal users override.

#### Added
- `paperwiki.config.layout` module with three default subdir constants
  (`DAILY_SUBDIR`, `SOURCES_SUBDIR`, `WIKI_SUBDIR`) used by reporters
  and the upcoming wiki backend.
- `Wiki/.drafts/` added to `.gitignore` for the upcoming wiki feature.

### Migration from earlier installs

If you have an existing setup that relied on the old default
`10_Daily` subdir, either:

- **Keep the numeric prefix**: pin `daily_subdir: 10_Daily` in your
  recipe's `obsidian` reporter config, or
- **Migrate to the friendly default**: `mv ~/Vault/10_Daily
  ~/Vault/Daily` and let the new default pick up.

The dedup filter scans recursively and reads frontmatter, so renaming
the directory does not break dedup.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- Initial release. Phases 0 through 5 of the foundation plan:
  plugin scaffolding, core domain models and protocols, async pipeline
  orchestrator, source plugins (arXiv, Semantic Scholar), filter
  plugins (recency, relevance, dedup), composite scorer, reporters
  (Markdown, Obsidian-flavored), recipe system, runners (digest,
  diagnostics), and three SKILLs (setup, digest, analyze).
- 281 tests, 93% coverage.
